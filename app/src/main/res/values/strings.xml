    <string name="snake_desc">
The snake moves at a constant speed only in north, south, east, or west direction. "Apples" appear at random locations and when the snake "eats" (runs into) an apple, it gets longer.
The game continues until the snake "dies". by either running into the edge of the board, or by running into its own tail.
The final score is based on the number of apples eaten by the snake.
The snake can be controlled by the arrow keys.</string>
    <string name="mine_desc">You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines, others don\'t. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.
Clicking a square which doesn\'t have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.</string>
    <string name="flag_desc">Each of the 10 questions asks you to identify the flag of a specific country and you are given several options to choose from. If you choose wrong, you can try another time until you guess the country.
    The score is based on how many times the right country was chosen on the first try.</string>

    <string name="snake_pres">Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms. After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest in the snake concept as it found a larger audience. There are over 300 Snake-like games for iOS alone.</string>
    <string name="mine_pres">Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden \"mines\" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. The game originates from the 1960s, and has been written for many computing platforms in use today. It has many variations and offshoots.</string>
    <string name="tetris_pres">Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov. The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984, while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow. He derived its name from combining the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (the falling pieces contain 4 segments) and tennis, Pajitnov\'s favorite sport. The name is also used in-game to refer to the play where four lines are cleared at once.</string>
